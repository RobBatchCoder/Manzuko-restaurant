# Manzuko Sushi Restaurant 

## Project Description
In this project the aim was to present and market the imagined sushi restaurant, Manzuko. With the aim
of converting website viewers into restarant customers a large importance was placed on appealing imagry
and appropriate styling. 
The website presents multiple oportunities for customer engagement with reservation
and comment tables in place. The nessersary information such as location, menus, restaurant
description and links to social media are provided. However, the customer isn't floaded with information, instead
attractive and inticing imagry is showcased drawing the customer in and encouraging further exploration.


## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is fully reponsive, it provides links to all 4 pages of the website. Included is also a reservation
button that opens a modal and the restaurant logo which acts as a link back to the home page. The nav bar remains fixed
to the top of the page when scrolling to allow easy navigation at all times.

The restaurant description section contains 2 divs, 1 spanning 2/3 of the page and the other spanning the remaining 1/3.
These divs contain attractive backgrounds. In the larger div is placed a card which describes the restaurant and the atmosphere it seeks to create. On mobile devices the second div is removed to improve spacing on the smaller screen.
