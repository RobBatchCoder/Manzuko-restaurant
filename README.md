# Project Description
In this project the aim was to present and market the imagined sushi restaurant, Manzuko. With the aim
of converting website viewers into restarant customers a large importance was placed on appealing imagry
and appropriate styling. 
The website presents multiple oportunities for customer engagement with reservation
and comment tables in place. The nessersary information such as location, menus, restaurant
description and links to social media are provided. However, the customer isn't floaded with information, instead
attractive and inticing imagry is showcased drawing the customer in and encouraging further exploration.


# User Experience (UX)
## Primary Goal
The goal of the Manzuko website is to create a pleasant and engaging site that demonstrates the strong asthetic nature
of the restuarant and products it produces. 

## Visitor Goals
Visitors to Manzuko tend to have an age of 25+ as the restraunt offers a high quality experience and customers pay a premium
for this. These users expect a professional, easy to use and intuitative user experience. Navigation, buttons and layout perform 
according to convention and these customers would be comfortable navigating the site on their first visit. The website will function
responsively as users will likey use a variety of devices when choosing a restaurant.

## First time visitor
* Users can easily access all pages through navigation bar.
* Menu items are immediately showcased in the crousel, encouraging further exploration. 
* Users are immediately able to make a reservation, saving them looking to find that function.
* Users are presented with vital information such as address and opening times in the footer element.

## Returning visitor
* A returning customer can quickly access menus and reservation booking to plan their visit.
* Returning customers can easily access social media links inorder to engage with the community
and learn about upcoming events.
* The contact page enables returning customers to leave a comment and know that their opinions matter.

# Creation Process
 
## 1. Strategy
* The website needs to be easy to interact with and navigate through as the intended users are not neccessarily tech savvy.
* The website must imeddiatley and consistantly showcase attract menu items and related imagry in order to draw the user in
and create desire.
* The website has to have a reservation system inorder to convert web users to restaurant attendees.
* The website requires a responsive design that remains visually appealing on all devices as potential customers will be accessing
the site from a variety of devices.

## 2. Scope
* The website contains only the most relevant information and instead focus on visually stimulating content.
* The website utalises the bootstrap framework inorder to create a mobile first responsive site.
* A brief description of the restaurant is included on the homepage.
* The restaurant is located in London so the website is designed mainly for London residents and tourists.

## 3. Structure
* The website has a consistent structure across all pages with a sticky nav bar so navigation from page to page remains easy
and intuitive across the site.
* The menu links section is displayed on the homepage and on its own dedicated page so that users can navigate to the menu section through the nav bar from any page on the site. This will ensure that the menus are easily available from any part of the website.
* The footer is consistant across all pages and it will include vital information such as, opening times, address and social media 
links. 
* The navigation bar and the restuarant description section will include a reservation button which will open a reservation model.

## 4. Skeleton
The site was designed to be simply, elegant and asthetically pleasing. 
* The logo is displayed at the top left of the view window on every page and acts as a link back to the homepage.
* The nav bar is fixed to the top of the page and allows easy and consistant navigation across the whole webpage. The current page
is underlined on the nav bar so users are always aware of their location on the page.
* The first thing a users sees upon loading the homepage is a large carousel that showcases the appealing menu items from the restaurant.
* For returning visitors who wish to leave a comment about their experience, th econtact link on the nav bar takes them straight 
to a form where they can input their personal information and a comment.
* The restuarant description section consists of 2 divs displaying background images on large screen sizes, on mobile view one of
these divs is removed to improve the balance and readability of this section.
* All links displayed on the page open in a new windown in the browsers. This prevents users from being taken away from the site 
and improves usability.
* The gallery page main secttion contains 9 high quality images. These images exist within the bootstrap column structure and are
adjust their position and size responsivly to the device being used.

## 5. Surface
The top level design remains consistant across all pages. Borders, margins and colors follow a consistent theme which allows all
elements to appear as they belong together.
* The colour Coral is used throughout the project as it represents the seafood element and remains sutle meeting the requirements 
of the project. The colour Eggshell contrasts well with coral and is used throughout the project also. Metallic Blue Seaweed is 
used sparingly to continue the seafood theme.
* To create an elegant and well balanced site, white spacing between elements is used frequently throughout the site.
* An importance is placed on the asthetics of the site so the selection of appropriate images was a top priority. High quality, colourful and contrasting images are used throughout.  

## 5. Wireframe 
The planning stage of this project included creating a wireframe in Figma. This allowed the number of pages, content required and 
layout to be determined before coding began.

## Colour Scheme
To generate the palette for the Manzuko project the website https://coolors.co was used. The palette began with the selection of 
coral for use with the logo and as the main colour theme of the website. Coral matched with the seafood theme of the website and it's
sutle nature matched with the desired direction for the website. The palette generator in https://coolors.co helped to adds colors to 
the palette that contrasted with coral but wouldn't clash. White was also used through the site inorder to create place between the many images used.

## Logo
The logo for this project was created on https://www.wix.com/logo/maker. The primary color chosen for the website was coral and this contrast nicely with eggshell, so these were the colours used for the logo design. The design was intented to be minimal to high light the sutle minimalist style of the design. With this in mind simply the Japanese text 満足 Manzuko, was chosen. This translates to satisfaction in English which worked well for the design.

## Typography
The fronts for this project were taken from https://www.cdnfonts.com/ . 
 * Shameimaru-sans was chosen for all headers in the project for its elegant and minimalist look. This suited the sutle and elegant     design for the project.

 sizes.

# Deployment

# Testing
Using the lighthouse testing facilty on Google Chrome highlighted a number of issues. 


## 1. Performance
* Performance was very poor. Pages took too long to load because of the size of the .png files.

    Solution; The large image files .png (10Mb~) where converted to .avif files. These generated a roughly
    90% reduction in files sizes and greatly improved performance.  

## 2. Accessabilty
* Accessability score was poor. Aria labels were missing from several elements and some aria labels weren't
unique.

    Solution; Unique aria labels were added to all elements missing them. Alt tags were also added to images.

## 3. Best Practices
* Initially best practices scored 100% so no changes were necessary.

## 4. Search engine optimization
* Search engine opimization scored poorly. 

    Solution; Meta description tag was added to give more information about the site upon a search. This brought
    the SEO score up to 100%. 

After several lighthouse tests and improvements the final scores are shown below.
